This folder is based on the replication package of "ASTN: A Novel Neural Source Code Representation based on Abstract Syntax Tree" [2]. This replication package saves many intermediate files for caching purposes, and we include all these files for ease of replication. For more details, please see https://github.com/zhangj111/astnn.
